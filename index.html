<h1>Get To Know Me</h1>

<div class="second-half">
<h2>I.T. Experience:</h2>
<p>I&#39m embarrassed to say, but my only I.T. experiences are from APC. In senior high we made a website, but I&#39ve forgotten everything about it. Last term we made a couple of games and I was assigned to be the game designer, UI designer, sound engineer, game scriptwriter, and documentation team. I think I can program if I wanted to and self-studied, but most of my classmates are already experienced in making games, so I let them take the reins. Sometimes I beat myself up about not being one of the programmers, but I realize that each member of the team bring their own expertise (and mine is story writing).</p>

<h2>Hobbies & Interests:</h2>
<p>Since forever I have loved stories. That&#39s why I love reading books and graphic novels as well as watching films and series. Another thing so dear in my heart is theatre. The music, dance, acting, sets, costumes, the audience… everything about it is divine! In all honesty, that is my true dream, but it&#39s expensive as heck to pursue it. I started to get into musicals in ninth grade, and around senior high kind of forgot about it, but in the past couple of months I have been once again obsessed. I have been a member of Teatré Phileo, APC&#39s theatre guild, since 2018, and I am currently the External Vice President. Once we have face-to-face classes, I&#39ll pounce on the opportunity to write and direct a play!</p>

<h2>Life Goals:</h2>
<p>This may sound cheesy, but I really just want to be happy. For now, I do not know what will bring me that. However, to sound like my life has a direction, I&#39ll say my goal is to use my (future) I.T. expertise in theatre and film. Perhaps in art, too.</p>

<h2>Course Expectations & Wants:</h2>
<p>Obvious from the course code, I expect to learn website programming in-depth. In senior high, for two consecutive terms we had the same teacher who just made us copy codes from a printed copy. Suffice to say that I did not learn anything. I do have high hopes for this class since we will utilize Khan Academy, and I was delighted with the experience of using it. Maybe for my major (MI), website coding for mobile would be helpful.</p>
